  Manage bare-metal Kubernetes clusters on metalstack.cloud https://metalstack.cloud.
  Note: As metalstack.cloud https://metalstack.cloud does not yet provide API Tokens, you currently need to pick your JWT from your web session. This is obviously going to change. After you logged in, open the Developer Tools of your browser, head to the console, filter for token and copy the JWT starting with eyJ.
  To get the project id, with dev tools open, switch to your project and open the clusters view. In the dev tools' network tab, search for api.v1.ClusterService/List, select a request with status 200, head to the payload and copy the project id. This is obviously going to change.
