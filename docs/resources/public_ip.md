## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) You can give your IP address a freely chosen name to identify it in the future.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Here you can give your IP an optional description for your own use.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Indicates when this IP address has initially been claimed.
- `id` (String) The ID that represents this public IP address.
- `ip` (String) The publicly accessible IP address.
- `network` (String) The network this address is bound to.
- `project` (String) The project this address is part of. Cannot be moved.
- `tags` (List of String) The tags used to organize this address.
- `type` (String) Determines the type of the public ip address. 
	If you want the IP to outlive the cluster lifecycle, mark it as static. Otherwise it will be deleted along with the cluster. 
	Another use case would be if you want to have a stable egress address on the internet gateway for your cluster.
- `updated_at` (String) Indicates when this IP address has been updated.
